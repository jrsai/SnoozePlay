</p>

Collaborated with 3 fellow Software Engineering Students to build a prototype that can be used in homes for 2 purposes: Firstly, keep track of who is in the room and play their selected playlists accordingly, and secondly, function as a smart home security unit to track any unusual movement and capture a photograph accordingly which is sent to the owner's email. 

<h1> Description </h1>
<p> The SpotiPi is an automated home entertainment system that is also equipped with an advanced security system.  </p>

<h1> What is does </h1>
<p> Using laser tripwires, the system keeps track of the number of people in the room and also plays music depending on where the user is in the house. By the click of a button, the user can switch it to security mode where the Pi Camera works along with the laser tripwires and motion sensors to detect any motion and capture a picture. </p>

<h1> How it was built </h1>
<p> 
<ul> 
<li> Raspberry Pi 2 </li>
<li> Motion Sensors </li> 
<li> Pi Camera </li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h1> Challenges </h1>
<p> The group was not able to get all the parts on time to be able to finish this project completely. We are looking to buy a motion sensor so that it works along with the Pi camera and take pictures of the intruder. </p>


<h1> Future plans </h1>
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Integrate other apps </li> 
<li> Better GUI </li>
<li> Ability to send the picture to the users phone to alert if there are any intruders </li> 
</ul>
